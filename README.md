# ChatterBox.py
A Discord Bot that specialises in text manipulation and colour chat, made by macpherson#1415 (@Errorcrafter) and coded completely using [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

**Warning: This bot is currently a work-in-progress and may be unstable! Make an issue on this repo's Issues page to report bugs!**

## Main Features
This bot uses Discord's syntax highlighting system, [Highlight.js](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/), to allow for basic colour chat with a small palette of  7 colours: red, yellow, orange, blue, green, cyan and gray. In the future, this bot will also have other text and image manipulation commands.

ChatterBox's main prefix is `cb!`, though `%` and `cb%` are also valid prefixes.

## Planned Features
Other miscellaneous text commands, such as drunkify, camelcase, etc. will be added, along with image manipulation comands made with [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow), a fork of Python's Imaging Library. Moderation and economy commands may also be added if demand for it is high.
