# ChatterBox.py
A Discord Bot that specialises in text manipulation and colour chat, made by macpherson#1415 (@Errorcrafter).

**Warning: This bot is currently a work-in-progress and may be unstable! Make an issue on this repo's Issues page to report bugs!**

This bot uses Discord's syntax highlighting system, [Highlight.js](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/), to allow for basic colour chat with a small palette of  7 colours: red, yellow, orange, blue, green, cyan and gray. In the future, this bot may also have other text and image manipulation commands.

ChatterBox's main prefix is `cb!`, though `%` and `cb%` are also valid prefixes.
